Never perished is Ukraine,

Nor her glory and freedom!

Still upon us, young brethren,

Fate shall smile!

Our enemies shall vanish

Like dew in the sun;

We too shall rule

In our beloved country. 

[Chorus]

Soul and body shall we lay down

For our freedom

And show that we are brethren

Of the Cossack nation 

Slava Ukraini!

Geroiam sava!

Slava natsii!

Smert' vorogam!


Putin Huilo!


Ukraina ponad use
